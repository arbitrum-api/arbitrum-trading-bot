Explanation:

    API URL: This is the base URL for making requests to the Arbitrum API.
    transfer_token function: This function sends a POST request to the Arbitrum API to transfer tokens from one address to another. It takes the sender's address, receiver's address, amount of tokens to send, token contract address, and the sender's private key.
    get_token_balance function: This function sends a GET request to fetch the balance of a specific token for a given address.

How to Use:

    Install the requests module if you donâ€™t have it yet:

pip install requests

Replace the placeholders (from_address, to_address, token_address, private_key) with your actual data.
Run the script to either transfer tokens or check the balance of tokens at the provided address.
